# Espotifai
This is the result of the final project for Object-Oriented Design and Programming (DPOO) by group C12 in the academic year 2021-22.

## System Requirements
IntelliJ IDEA 2021.2.1 (Ultimate Edition).

To run the program, it is necessary to have IntelliJ IDE installed with SDK 17.

## Libraries
To run the program without any issues, make sure to have all the libraries from the [libs](res/libs) folder in the project structure.

## Usage Instructions
To run the application, the user needs to compile and execute the program. Afterward, a tab will open displaying the initial view of the application (in this case, the login page where the user can start their account in the system). Once this is done, with the user already registered or logged in, any desired functionality of the application can be executed.
